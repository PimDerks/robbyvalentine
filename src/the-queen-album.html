<h2>Robby's introduction</h2>

<p>Flashback to November 1975! I was only six years old, when lightning struck me, in the form of Bohemian Rhapsody, radiating from our television. I was just allowed to start taking piano-lessons, but it was not until after that first glimpse of Freddie Mercury that I knew why; everything that I had seen and heard was everything I wanted to become.</p>

<p>In December that same year, my grandmother gave me ‘A Night at the Opera’ for my seventh birthday. I practiced all the songs on the piano, became a member of the fanclub, collected anything about the band that I could get my hands on and also went to all their concerts when they played in the Netherlands. I remember saying to myself when I was a kid: ‘Freddie Mercury’s voice and the music of Queen is the most beautiful thing that will ever be heard on this planet!’ I still feel the same until this day.</p>

<p>For years, I resisted the temptation to cover Queen’s songs as it felt like blasphemy. Perhaps I was just afraid it would ruin the magic; afraid of the amount of work; afraid of the answer to the question: why? Nobody on earth could ever do it better than Queen. What kind of an idiot would try to copy the Mona Lisa?</p>

<p>In 2011 I was idiot enough. That resulted in ‘A Tribute To’ Queen, followed by ‘A Tribute To Queen 2’ in 2012.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2014; now in your hands: ‘The Queen Album’! I wanted to combine the first two tribute albums, add five new songs, and create this ultimate 80-minute tribute album. Apart from ‘Under Pressure’ all songs are from the 1970’s, my favorite Queen era. I tried to stay as close to the original as I possibly could, while at the same time adding my personal touch.</p>

<p>Meticulously working out the arrangements, recording the instruments, and singing all the vocal lines gave me lots of headaches and frustration; but most of all it brought me satisfaction and pleasure; and new magical moments that I had never discovered before as a passive Queen listener. My admiration and adoration for Queen  has grown even
stronger. The magic is not ruined… It’s bigger than ever!</p>

<p>Freddie, Brian, Roger and John…. Thank you! For everything.</p>
