<p>With support of an amazing band, <em>Andre Borgman</em> (Drums), <em>Paul Coenradie</em> (Guitar), <em>Luuk van Gerven</em> (Bass Guitar), <em>Johan ‘Jay Jay’ Willems</em> (Keys, Backing Vocals), rest assured this will be an unforgettable show!

<p>This unique album is a bizarre mix of Pop and Rock genres! Although Valentine’s career in the Netherlands was promising; his music touched many; including a long running success in Japan.</p>

<p>With the release of Bizarro World we can expect a renewed European success!</p>
