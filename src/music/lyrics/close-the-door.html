<p>Touch me, make me feel that you still love me<br />
    Nowadays it doesn't show, you know</p>

<p>Touch me, like the way you used to touch me<br />
    But everyday the distance grows, it shows</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>I can tell it by the look in your eyes (oooooohh)<br />
    I can feel it when you kiss me goodnight (oooooohh)<br />
    It is plain to see you don't love me no more<br />
    So why don't you close the door</p>

<p>Hold me, like the way you used to hold me<br />
    Nowadays it feels so cold<br />
    But you did cross me, I can't believe you double-crossed me<br />
    And act as if there's nothing wrong, but I know</p>

<p class="em">(Repeat chorus x 2)</p>

<p>Tell it by the look in your eyes (oooooohh)<br />
    I can feel it when you kiss me goodnight (oooooohh)<br />
    Yeah you're making me feel you don't love me no more<br />
    So why don't we close , why don't you close<br />
    Why don't we close the door</p>
